# 🟡 SECTION 1: Testing Infrastructure Setup
*Priority: HIGH | Estimated Time: 2-4 hours | Dependencies: None*

## 1.1 Backend Jest Configuration Issue

### 1.1.1 Babel Preset Configuration Missing  
**File:** `backend/jest.config.js` or `backend/package.json`
**Status:** 🔧 NEEDS ATTENTION - Jest tests failing due to missing @babel/preset-env
**Issue:** Jest cannot run tests due to missing babel configuration for ES modules

**Current Error:**
```
● Validation Error:
Preset @babel/preset-env not found.
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Backend uses ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- Jest requires babel configuration to handle ES modules properly
- Missing babel presets for ES module transformation during testing

**Recommended Fix:**
```javascript
// backend/jest.config.js
export default {
  preset: '@babel/preset-env',
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.js$': 'babel-jest'
  },
  extensionsToTreatAsEsm: ['.js'],
  globals: {
    'ts-jest': {
      useESM: true
    }
  },
  moduleNameMapping: {
    '^(\\.{1,2}/.*)\\.js$': '$1'
  }
};
```

**Required Dependencies:**
```bash
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-jest
```

**Impact:** Critical for development workflow - tests currently cannot run at all.

### 1.1.2 Alternative: Native ES Modules Testing
**Alternative Solution:** Use native ES modules testing without Babel

**Recommended Modern Approach:**
```javascript
// backend/jest.config.js
export default {
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  extensionsToTreatAsEsm: ['.js'],
  transform: {},
  testMatch: ['**/__tests__/**/*.test.js'],
  collectCoverage: true,
  coverageDirectory: 'coverage',
  coverageReporters: ['text', 'lcov', 'html']
};
```

**Required Node.js flags:**
```json
// backend/package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "node --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js"
  }
}
```

## 1.2 Frontend Testing Enhancement  

### 1.2.1 React Testing Library Integration
**Current Status:** ✅ Dependencies installed, tests placeholder exists
**Enhancement Needed:** Actual test implementation for core components

**Priority Components for Testing:**
- `LeafletMap` component - Core map functionality
- `LocationCard` component - Location display logic  
- `AuthForm` component - Authentication flows
- `SearchBar` component - Search functionality
- `ErrorBoundary` component - Error handling

**Sample Test Structure:**
```typescript
// frontend/src/components/Map/__tests__/LeafletMap.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { LeafletMap } from '../LeafletMap';

describe('LeafletMap', () => {
  test('renders map container', () => {
    render(<LeafletMap locations={[]} />);
    expect(screen.getByRole('main')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
  test('displays loading state', () => {
    render(<LeafletMap locations={[]} isLoading={true} />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Loading campus map...')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## 🎯 Section 1 Success Criteria
